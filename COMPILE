How to compile
--------------

  After cvs checkout, please cd to ricpp and use first 'cvs update -P'
  to prune empty directories.

  Then use prepare.bat in ricpp\workspaces one time to copy some files to
  their appropriate places.

  The project can be compiled with
  Visual Studio 6,        workspace is ricpp\workspaces\vc6\ricpp.dsw
  Visual Studio 2003.net, soulution is ricpp\workspaces\vc7\ricpp.sln
  MinGW and MinGW32 using Dev-CPP, see below
  MinGW32 using CBuilderX, see below

Source format
-------------

  Should be 4 blanks for Tab and indents and additional indents. Tabs only
  at the beginning (normally) of a line. Blocks are in diagonal curley brackets.

Additional libraries needed
---------------------------

  libtiff: tiff-3.7.2 (GnuWin32), libtiff.lib used to link by the glrenderer.
  zlib: zlib-1.2.2 (GnuWin32), libz.lib used to link by the ribparser.

  The includes and libs and DLLs are included with the ricpp\workspace\3rdparty
  directory.

  The additional dll's are copied to the out (execution) pathes by prepare.bat:

  libtiff3.dll  (from tiff-3.7.2, GnuWin32)
  libjpeg62.dll (from libjpeg-6b, GnuWin32)
  zlib1.dll     (from zlib-1.2.2, GnuWin32)

  For some test programms you will also need Qt (>= 2.6) or wxWindows (2.4.2)
  with their dynamic libraries.

Using Visual Studio
-------------------

  These files are created in the workspaces exe\debug and exe\release:

    ricpptest.exe, demo for the lib
    ribpreview.exe, sample with mutidocument interface
    ribloader.exe, sample with single document interface
    context\glrenderer.dll, context\ribout.dll, the renderer contexts
    and test progs for wxWindows, qt in seperate projects

  After compiling the project with batch build you can use
  copylib.bat (in vc6, vc7, DevCPP) to copy to the ricpplib directory
  of the workspace.

  After building the main files you can build the progsamples (only for
  library testing). Use prepare.bat in progsamples\workspaces first to
  copy some files to their appropriate places. The project files can be
  found in the progsamples\workspaces subfolders. Another
  progsamples\RIBPreview (.net only, a 'howto' sample) is only a vc7 project.

  The progsamples\testrib uses the ribparser and the intermediate
  renderer classes (all linked statically) to parse a RIB file and
  output the errors on a command console.

Using Dev-CPP (MinGW)
---------------------

  After preparing the workspaces (prepare.bat) and edited the configuration file
  ricpp\workspace\DevCPP\ricpp.def to use the Path of DevCPP (MinGW), you can
  use Dev-CPP (4.9.80 with gcc 3.2) or MinGW 3.1.0-1 with gcc 3.2.3 to compile
  the projects test files.

  For the DevCPP .dev Projects in the Debug and Release subdirectories,
  please use DevCPP to compile in the following order:

    glcpp
    rendererloader
    ribparser
    rendercontext
    rimesh
    libglrenderer
    glrenderer
    libribout
    ribout
    ricpptest

    testrib (progamples)

  The executables will be in exe\Debug\out or exe\Release\out.

  There are user defined Makefiles, so you can also change to workspace\DevCPP
  and call 'make' to make all (also possible: release, debug, clean, cleandebug
  and cleanrelease). Please use the version of make.exe that comes with RiCPP.
  There are Makefiles for every subproject and configuration.
  
  The source file dependencies are edited manually by now and stored at
  workspace\depend\ricpp.dep.

Using CBuilderX (test)
----------------------

  First you probably need to set an environment variable

  BCBX       : Base path of CBuilderX, e.g. C:\CBuilderX

  CBuilderX can be loaded with ricpp\workspaces\CBuilderX\ricpp.bpgr. The results
  should go to ricpp\workspaces\CBuilderX\build\gnuwin32\Debug\exe or
  ricpp\workspaces\CBuilderX\build\gnuwin32\Relaese\exe. Only ricpptest and testrib
  are build at the moment. Compiler is MinGW on the Windows platform only.

Compiling with Gnu-C++ under Linux (static Libs only, test)
-----------------------------------------------------------

  Change to the ricpp/workspace/linux directory. There is a file called
  ricpp.def.temp (included by makefile), copy it to ricpp.def.
  Mesa, libtiff, libjpeg and libz are used additionally.
  You can call make to compile and link the libraries (static libraries
  at the moment) to the Debug and Release subdirectories of the workspace
  directories. The compiler used is g++ version 3.x.
  There is one executable glxTest to read a rib file and display
  it using in an X Window with Mesa. The output is very experimental.
  Another executeable: testrib reads a rib file and prints messages
  for rib errors found.

Have fun,
Andreas
