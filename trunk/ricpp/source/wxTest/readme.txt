wxTest
------

wxTest is a quick and dirty 'hack' which can be compiled
with wxWindows 2.4.2. You must first obtain, set the WXWIN
environment variable to the root and compile the dll (debug
and release) version of wxWindows 2.4.2.

For DevCPP: Please edit
the _wxTest.dev files to wxTest.dev: replace $(WXWIN)
with the path of your wxWindows (e.g. c:/wxWindows2.4.2).
The output goes to the appropriate exe/out subdirectory.
