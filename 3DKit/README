Adapted for RiCPP Andreas Pidde

RiCPP 3dkit based havily on 3dkit and gnu3dkit. It is very experimental. The author tries to get
the (Gnu)3dkit object structure working together with RiCPP. It will be first compiled for Apple's
Cocoa and if that works for GnuStep. The main differences between the 3dkit and RiCPP 3dkit headers
are some adoptions for Cocoa and using naming scheme of G3DKit. The implementation files
differ.
